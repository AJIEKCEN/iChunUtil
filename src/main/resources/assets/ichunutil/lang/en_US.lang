ichun.config.keybind.comment=If you're reading this, I would strongly recommend changing the keybinds ingame.\niChunUtil uses custom keybinds. Go to the options page and hit O to show other options.\n\nIf you really have to edit the config file, the format is <key code>, and append either ":SHIFT", ":CTRL", or ":ALT" for keys you want to hold down at the same time.\nFor key codes go to: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Key_codes \nExample: 48:SHIFT:ALT will bind to the B key when you hold Shift and Alt.
